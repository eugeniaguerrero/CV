I am a full-stack developer with an interest in back-end roles. I'm interested in Machine Learning, hardware, and agile methodologies.

I have practical experience in research and finance. Previous personal and professional experiences have highlighted the differing powerful applications of software, encouraging me to dedicate myself to software enginerring. I'm currently doing an MSc in Computing Science at Imperial, which is an intense course that I feel will make me a more informed, more conscientious software engineer. 

## Skills
- I have previous experience working in teams of all sizes, whether in a professional or sports setting. Pairing and working in teams throughout past tasks and in my last software development role has built upon and enhanced my capacity to understand the needs of a prospective client and work in an agile manner to deliver the optimal outcome for both the client and the business.

- I am an effective communicator, whether it be with a pair partner or in a group setting. This is due to both professional and personal experiences highlighting the importance of communication. I rowed for three years at university, during which I was a coxswain for the men's squad, a position where effective and concise communication and unity meant the difference between coming together as a team or splintering apart. Seeing the impact that communication had on the team heightened my interest towards giving and receiving feedback, which is something that I've integrated on a daily basis since then.

- My previous background as a researcher means that I pay attention to details and am good at spotting patterns, which are extremely helpful when debugging or when tackling a new technology. I also appreciate the importance of having a growth mindset, persisting when learning new things or when faced with a mental block.

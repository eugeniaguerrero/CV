I am a full-stack developer with an interest in Ruby, JavaScript, and agile
methodologies.

I am a King’s College London Political Economy graduate with practical experience of research and finance. Previous personal and professional experiences have highlighted the differing powerful applications of software, encouraging me to dedicate myself to software development. I'm looking for a role as a Junior Full-Stack Developer, which would build on my existing skills and knowledge base whilst challenging me on a day-to-day basis.

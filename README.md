I am a King’s College London Political Economy graduate with practical experience of research and finance. Previous personal and professional experiences have highlighted the differing powerful applications of software, encouraging me to dedicate myself to software development. I am learning the principles of software craftsmanship at [Makers Academy] (http://www.makersacademy.com), Europe's leading Web Developer bootcamp.
I'm looking for a role as a Junior Full-Stack Developer, which would build on my existing skills and knowledge base whilst challenging me on a day-to-day basis.
